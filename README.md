Dylan Krueger Portfolio 1 Posts App.

https://kroogucf.github.io/posts-app/

So this app is meant to be a blog 'post' type app.

I originally took the assignment from last week where we built the Repetition Exercise and the Duration Exercise as the assignment to 'build on to'.

This quickly turned into kind of a combination of some of the other projects though from so far this semester into this posts app.

I structured my 'blog posts' around Marvel and the MCU.

Some of the features are.

1. Multiple 'Screens' each for a different 'blog post'
2. A like counter to like the post and display how many times the post has been liked.
3. A quote generator that pulls from an array of some of my favorite quotes from WandaVision and displays them when a button is pressed. (on the WandaVision post specifically)
4. A report post button (That removes the post from the screen, specifically on the Falcon and the Winter Soldier page)
5. A return button that allows you to go back to the main post screen.
6. CSS styles throughout

I kept the multiple screens from that react project for a repetition exercise and also kept the repetition exercise itself but turned it into the 'like counter' for this portfolio projects purpose.

I hope that portfolio 2 is a build on of this assignment that way I can go for a full on blog post type site!
